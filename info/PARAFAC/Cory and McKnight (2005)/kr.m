% The Khatri - Rao product
% For two matrices with similar column dimension the khatri-Rao product
% is kr(A,B) = [kron(A(:,1),B(:,1)) .... kron(A(:,F),B(:,F))]
% 
% I/O AB = kr(A,B);
%
% kr(A,B) equals ppp(B,A) - where ppp is the triple-P product = 
% the parallel proportional profiles product which was originally 
% suggested in Bro, Ph.D. thesis, 1998
